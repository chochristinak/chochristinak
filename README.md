- 👋 Hi, I’m Christina @chochristinak
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript to enhance my code quality and reliability.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other devs who consider themselves mental athletes, on a full-stack MERN app we can proudly showcase in our portfolios. E-mail me if you're interested in working on a project together!
- 📫 How to reach me: chochristinak@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I live in a place that has surfable waves almost every day of the year!
